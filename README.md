 Data / ML Engineering - remote challenge

#### Hello Alima dev :)

#### In this repository you will find the scripts to the remote challenge.

#### The following files have all the information needed:
- task_1_scrapping_data.py does the scrapping and returns a json file that will serve as the needed list of dicts.
- task_2_data_analysis.py will read the json file and carry out the necessary analysis. An important note is that the predict N future days part of the problem is recieved as a keyboard input.
- task_3_q1.sql contains the query to question 1.
- task_3_q2.sql contains the query to question 2.

#### About the additional files:
- task_1.json serves as a backup for task 2.
- dict_list.json should be generated by task_1_scrapping_data.py and should be exactly the same as task_1.json.
- requirements.txt contains the needed libraries and their versions.
- avocado_predictor.h5 is a TensorFlow model generated by task_2_data_analysis.py.
- tasks.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that's not needed for this challenge; it was used as a scrapbook.
